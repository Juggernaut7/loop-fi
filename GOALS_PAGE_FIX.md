# 🎯 Goals Page Fixed - Real Backend Integration

## ✅ All Changes Complete!

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. **Real Backend API Integration** ✅
- Now properly fetches goals from `/api/goals` endpoint
- Sends `walletAddress` as query parameter
- Handles response format correctly
- Creates goals with proper data structure

#### 2. **Switched from STX to CELO** ✅
- All currency references updated to CELO
- Removed blockchain-specific conversions (microSTX)
- Updated UI labels from "Target Amount (STX)" to "Target Amount (CELO)"
- Contribution schedule now shows CELO amounts

#### 3. **Used useWallet Hook** ✅
- Replaced manual wallet connection checks
- Now uses `const { isConnected, address, balance } = useWallet()`
- Automatically stays in sync with wallet state
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

#### 4. **User-Friendly Language** ✅
- "Contribution Schedule" → "Savings Plan"
- Success messages more friendly and encouraging
- Clear error messages without technical jargon

#### 5. **Proper Error Handling** ✅
```javascript
// Shows specific backend errors
if (error.response?.data?.error) {
  toast.error(`Failed to create goal: ${error.response.data.error}`);
}
```

## 📡 API Endpoints Used

### GET Goals
```javascript
GET /api/goals?walletAddress=0x...
Response: {
  success: true,
  data: [
    {
      _id: "...",
      name: "Emergency Fund",
      targetAmount: 2.5,
      currentAmount: 0,
      endDate: "2025-12-31",
      frequency: "monthly",
      amount: 0.2,
      category: "Savings",
      user: "0x...",
      createdAt: "2025-01-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST Create Goal
```javascript
POST /api/goals
Body: {
  name: "Emergency Fund",
  description: "Save for emergencies",
  targetAmount: 2.5,
  endDate: "2025-12-31",
  frequency: "monthly",
  amount: 0.2,
  category: "Savings",
  walletAddress: "0x..."
}
```

### POST Create Group
```javascript
POST /api/groups
Body: {
  name: "Family Vacation",
  description: "Save together for vacation",
  targetAmount: 10.0,
  maxMembers: 5,
  endDate: "2025-07-01",
  category: "Group Savings",
  walletAddress: "0x..."
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Loading Goals:
```
1. Page loads
2. Checks wallet connection via useWallet hook
3. If connected → fetches goals from backend
4. Displays goals with real data
5. If not connected → shows empty state
```

### Creating a Goal:
```
1. User fills form (name, amount, deadline)
2. Validates wallet is connected
3. Sends POST request to /api/goals with walletAddress
4. Backend creates goal in MongoDB
5. Refreshes goal list
6. Shows success message
```

### Data Flow:
```
Frontend (GoalsPage)
    ↓
useWallet Hook (gets address)
    ↓
API Service (axios)
    ↓
Backend (/api/goals)
    ↓
MongoDB (stores goal)
    ↓
Response back to frontend
    ↓
Updates UI with new goal
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

✅ **Load Goals**: Opens page and fetches from backend  
✅ **Empty State**: Shows when no goals exist  
✅ **Create Goal**: Saves to backend and refreshes list  
✅ **Create Group**: Saves group savings to backend  
✅ **Wallet Required**: Shows error if not connected  
✅ **Error Handling**: Shows backend validation errors  
✅ **Currency Display**: All amounts show CELO

## 📝 Console Logs to Expect

### On Page Load:
```
📡 Loading goals data for wallet: 0x...
✅ Goals loaded: [...]
✅ Groups loaded: [...]
```

### When Creating Goal:
```
💰 Creating savings goal: { name: "...", targetAmount: 2.5, ... }
📤 Sending to backend: { ... }
✅ Goal created: { _id: "...", ... }
```

### When Creating Group:
```
👥 Creating group savings: { name: "...", maxMembers: 5, ... }
📤 Sending to backend: { ... }
✅ Group created: { _id: "...", ... }
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Before:
- Technical terms: "vault", "microSTX", "block height"
- STX currency everywhere
- Manual wallet checks

### After:
- User-friendly: "savings goal", "CELO", "target date"
- CELO currency everywhere
- useWallet hook integration
